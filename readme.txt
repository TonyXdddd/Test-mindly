                                                       without adaptive.
                                        As the resolution increases, the baseline to which the 
                                        components are vertically aligned breaks down as each 
                                        slide has a dynamic width. I did not change this behavior, 
                                        which is hardcoded into ionic. baseline was respected at 
                                        resolution 375 - the value of the test task layout width.
